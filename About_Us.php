    <h1>About Us</h1><hr />
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>When I started learning C/C++ in college, I found that there are tons of simple tutorials with examples. There wasn’t any way to 
    	test your skills/knowledge so it was really hard for students like me to test his/her knowledge. 
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>What we’re working on</h3>
    <p>I am always working to make it better resource for our users. We constantly update our articles to improve their quality 
    	and	correctness.
        In future I am going to add programming tutorials like C,C++,Java,Python etc to help our users all over the world learn it through 
        our simple teaching methodology.
    </p>
    <h3>We’d love to talk!</h3>
    <p>If you wish to know more about us or advertise on our website, feel free to contact us and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
